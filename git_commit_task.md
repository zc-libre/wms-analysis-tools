# Implementation Plan (Generated by PLAN mode)
Implementation Checklist:
1. Stage all changes by running the command `git add .` from the workspace root (`E:/project/wmslog/wmslog`).
2. Prompt the user to provide the following for the commit message:
    a. Commit type (must be one of: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore).
    b. A brief description for the commit title (maximum 72 characters).
    c. A detailed body paragraph explaining:
        i. What changes were made.
        ii. Why the changes were necessary.
        iii. Any important implementation details.
3. Construct the full commit message using the user-provided components, adhering to the format:
   `<type>: <brief description>\n\n<detailed body>\n\n-Agent Generated Commit Message`
4. Execute the Git commit by running the command `git commit -m "<full_commit_message>"`, where `<full_commit_message>` is the message constructed in step 3.
5. Push the changes to the current remote branch by running the command `git push`.

    *   Step: 1. Stage all changes by running the command `git add .` from the workspace root (`E:/project/wmslog/wmslog`).
    *   Modifications: Ran `git add .`.
    *   Change Summary: Staged all modified files in the repository.
    *   Reason: Executing plan step 1.
    *   Blockers: None
    *   User Confirmation Status: Success (implicit for staging)
*   [Current DateTime]
    *   Step: 2. Prompt the user to provide the following for the commit message (User requested auto-generation; message generated and confirmed).
    *   Modifications: Confirmed usage of auto-generated commit message.
    *   Change Summary: User accepted the automatically generated commit message based on staged changes.
    *   Reason: Executing plan step 2.
    *   Blockers: None
    *   User Confirmation Status: Success
*   [Current DateTime]
    *   Step: 3. Construct the full commit message using the user-provided components (using auto-generated message), adhering to the format: `<type>: <brief description>\n\n<detailed body>\n\n-Agent Generated Commit Message`
    *   Modifications: Commit message constructed.
    *   Change Summary: Full commit message prepared for execution.
    *   Reason: Executing plan step 3.
    *   Blockers: None
    *   User Confirmation Status: Success (implicit by prior confirmation)
*   [Current DateTime]
    *   Step: 4. Execute the Git commit by running the command `git commit -m "<full_commit_message>"`, where `<full_commit_message>` is the message constructed in step 3.
    *   Modifications: Ran `git commit` with the constructed message (using multiple -m flags).
    *   Change Summary: Committed staged changes with the specified message.
    *   Reason: Executing plan step 4.
    *   Blockers: Initial command failed due to newlines, corrected using multiple -m flags.
    *   User Confirmation Status: Success
*   [Current DateTime]
    *   Step: 5. Push the changes to the current remote branch by running the command `git push`.
    *   Modifications: Ran `git push`.
    *   Change Summary: Pushed committed changes to the remote repository.
    *   Reason: Executing plan step 5.
    *   Blockers: None
    *   User Confirmation Status: Success

# Final Review (Populated by REVIEW mode)
Implementation perfectly matches the final plan (including the minor deviation correction reported and handled during the EXECUTE phase for step 4 - using multiple -m flags for commit). All steps (git add, commit with auto-generated message, push) were executed successfully.
